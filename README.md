# EVs & Charging Infrastructure in NY

## I. Overview
The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) presents both opportunities and challenges for transportation electrification in the US. This project investigates the alignment between EV adoption patterns and public charging infrastructure deployment across ZIP codes and counties in New York State. By analyzing vehicle registration records and EV charging station data from 2010 to 2025, the study identifies spatial and temporal mismatches that may hinder equitable access to EV technology and inform strategic infrastructure planning. Particular attention is given to areas where EV registrations have surged recently (2023â€“2025), revealing potential lag in infrastructure support. Through detailed visualizations and heatmaps, this analysis highlights not only the growth trajectory of EV usage but also critical infrastructure gaps that may affect continued adoption, especially outside of historically prioritized urban cores.

   * 2022-2024: Dense statewide network (2,338 total) with heavy concentration in NYC metro region and coverage extending to most populated areas

3. **Cumulative EV Charger Growth (2010-2025)**

   ![Cumulative EV Charger Growth](graphs/ev_chargers_timeline.png)
   
   * Exponential growth in total charger installations:
   * Slow initial deployment (1-163 chargers) from 2010-2015
   * Accelerating growth (291-1,296 chargers) from 2016-2020
   * Dramatic expansion (2,084-4,720 chargers) from 2021-2025
   * The curve steepens significantly after 2020, indicating rapid infrastructure scaling

4. **Registration Type Trends (2014-2025)**

   ![Registration Types by Year](graphs/reg_type_year_heatmap.png)
   
   * Significant shift in EV registration classifications:
   * 2014-2022: Dominated by PSD (Political Subdivision) registrations with minor STA (State Owned Vehicle) presence
   * 2023-2025: Major transition to PAS (Passenger) classification (>75% of registrations)
   * Emergence of diverse registration types in later years (Commerical, Speacial Registration Fee, Omnibus Private Rental, Organizations, Limited Use Automobile, Medical)
   * This indicates evolution in the types of EVs being registered and potentially policy/classification changes

5. **ZIP Code Distribution of EV Registrations (2014-2025)**

   ![ZIP Code Registration Distribution](graphs/zip_year_pct_heatmap.png)
   
   * Temporal pattern of registrations across top ZIP codes:

   * Significant concentration in 2023-2025 period across all ZIP codes
   * Most ZIP codes show highest registration activity in 2024 (>55% of their total registrations)
   * 2025 data showing continued strong adoption (typically 15-25% of total)

   * Adoption hotspots:
   * Newark (zip: 7114) dramatically leads with 2,850 registrations
   * Second-tier adoption in East Elmhurst (zip: 11369) with 1,621 EVs and Brooklyn (zip: 11208) with 1,379 EVs
   * Significant drop-off after top 7 ZIP codes (all with >800 registrations)

### Charger-Registration Alignment Analysis

When comparing the EV charger distribution with registration hotspots, several important mismatches become apparent:

* **Major Adoption-Infrastructure Gap**: Newark has the highest EV registrations (2,850) but doesn't appear in the top 20 for charger installations
* **Infrastructure-Rich Areas with Lower Adoption**: Several locations with high public charging counts (Spring Valley, Saratoga Valley, and Albany) don't appear in the top registration areas
* **Geographic Disparities**: The registration data suggests high concentration in certain suburban communities, while charger infrastructure appears more distributed along transportation corridors
* **Temporal Differences**: The registration surge is very recent (2023-2025) while charger installation has been more gradual since 2018, suggesting infrastructure may be playing catch-up

## V. Key Findings

1. **EV Adoption Acceleration**
   * EV registrations have exploded in New York State since 2023, with over 50% of registrations occurring in 2024 alone
   * Registration patterns show extreme concentration in certain ZIP codes, with Newark having nearly twice as many registrations as the second-highest
   * A significant shift from political subdivision to regular passgenger vehicle in 2023 suggests either a policy change in vehicle registration or a fundamental shift in the types of EVs being purchased. EV adoption switched from governmental used vehicle to more widely usage in general population

2. **Charging Infrastructure Evolution**
   * EV charger deployment shows a clear four-phase pattern:
     - Pilot phase (2010-2014): Limited installations averaging under 20 per year
     - Early growth (2015-2018): Moderate expansion averaging ~125 per year
     - Acceleration (2019-2021): Rapid deployment averaging ~500 per year
     - Maturation (2022-2024): Sustained high installation rates averaging ~780 per year
   * Cumulative charger count has grown exponentially, reaching 4,720 by 2025
   * Installation has focused on creating statewide coverage while ensuring concentration in high-traffic areas

3. **Critical Infrastructure-Adoption Misalignment**
   * The analysis reveals substantial geographic mismatches between areas with high EV adoption and those with robust charging infrastructure
   * Top registration areas often have disproportionately fewer chargers relative to their EV population
   * Several areas with extensive charging infrastructure show comparatively lower EV registration rates
   * The rapid acceleration of adoptions in 2023-2024 has outpaced infrastructure development in key communities

4. **Temporal Patterns**
   * Charger installations showed steady growth from 2015-2021 before stabilizing at a higher level
   * EV registrations remained relatively low until 2023, then surged dramatically
   * This timing gap suggests infrastructure development preceded and potentially enabled the subsequent adoption boom

5. **Geographic Concentration**
   * Both charger installations and EV registrations show distinct geographic clustering
   * NYC metropolitan area dominates in both categories, though not always in the same specific ZIP codes
   * Secondary clusters appear around Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and along the Hudson Valley corridor


## VI. Conclusion and Recommendations

This project highlights the dynamic and uneven growth of electric vehicle adoption and public charging infrastructure in New York State. Key takeaways include the exponential rise in EV registrations, especially in 2023â€“2024, outpacing infrastructure growth in several high-adoption ZIP codes. While charging infrastructure has expanded significantly since 2015, especially in urban and high-traffic areas, the current network does not consistently align with emerging adoption hotspots, such as Newark and East Elmhurst.

**For Policymakers and Infrastructure Planners:**
* Targeted Infrastructure Deployment: Policymakers should prioritize investment in areas showing rapid EV adoption but limited charging capacity, using predictive models to anticipate future demand.

* Equity-Oriented Planning: ZIP code-level disparities suggest that public charging infrastructure may be underserving lower-income or high-density residential communities. Addressing these gaps is critical to avoid deepening mobility inequities.

* Integrated Planning Timelines: The data reveal a temporal disconnectâ€”charging infrastructure scaled earlier, but EV adoption has surged more recently. Future programs should better coordinate rollout timelines to ensure readiness for market shifts.
